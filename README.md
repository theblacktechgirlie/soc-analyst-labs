# SOC Analyst Labs Portfolio – Diamond Lee

This repository contains hands-on security operations and SIEM labs focused on log analysis, incident detection, and investigation workflows.  
These projects demonstrate my practical training as an aspiring SOC Analyst with experience in Splunk, networking analysis, and cloud security fundamentals.

## 🔐 Skills Demonstrated
- Log analysis and event correlation using Splunk  
- Incident investigation and documentation  
- Network traffic analysis with Wireshark  
- Understanding of SIEM data ingestion and data pipelines  
- Cloud security fundamentals (AWS EC2, logging concepts)

## 🧪 Labs Included

### 1. [Failed Login Investigation (Splunk)](splunk-labs/failed-login-investigation)
- Investigated multiple failed login attempts
- Identified source IP and whether it was internal or external
- Checked for successful authentication after failures
- Determined activity classification (false positive vs suspicious)


### 2. [Brute-Force Attack Detection (Splunk)](splunk-labs/brute-force-detection)

- Analyzed high-volume authentication failures across multiple time windows
- Identified repeated login attempts targeting the same account from a single source
- Detected brute-force behavior based on failure frequency thresholds
- Correlated authentication events to confirm attack pattern
- Documented findings and escalated per incident response procedures


### 3. Network Traffic Analysis
- Reviewed packet captures to identify abnormal behavior  
- Correlated network traffic with log events  

### 3. Cloud Logging Fundamentals
- Explored AWS EC2 logging and monitoring concepts  
- Reviewed security event sources and alerting workflows  

## 📌 Tools & Technologies
- Splunk  
- Wireshark  
- AWS EC2  
- Linux & Windows
